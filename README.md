# HTML / CSS code test #
This is a short code test for front-end developers at Fintek Software.

Please look at the "Crowdfunding box.PNG" image in this directory. Your task is to recreate this image using HTML and CSS.  

You can use the skeleton index.html and style.css file to do this if you want. This is just a suggestion - 
if you have a different structure you prefer, please use that instead.

The example style.css file contains hex codes for all of the colours used in the crowdfunding box. The font
used is "Roboto" - this is already linked in the index.html file.
